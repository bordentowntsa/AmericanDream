   <h1> THE SWITCH</h1>
   <h4 class = "hist">Around 1954, the oreo had grown out of its thirty year old design and was redesigned to incorporate the Nabisco brand. At this point the cookie looks like the cookie that we all know and love. The creators of the Oreo then started to create advertisements for the Oreo. By 1974 the Oreo ahd gone through many titles and it was finally settled to have the name of the Chocolate Sandwich Cookie. Another major switch was when in 1990 the Oreo became healthier by replacing trans-fat with the healthier alternative of vegetable oil.</h4>
