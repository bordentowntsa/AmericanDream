   <h4> After a 6 month hiatus from touring the band is back on the road stronger then ever. This year it will only consist of only American cities, but next year the band will be touring European, Asian, African, and South American countries. Each tour event, both in the US and outside of the US, will have more safety measures, but the American Dreamers wants all of their fans to be content with their experience. For this reason the band will provide each atendee with a free  $25 gift of their choice from the American Dreamers store. Along with the increased safety measures each event will have an increased number of performers. Each event will feature an aspiring dancer, singer, comedian, magician, or any other performer who wants to achieve the American Dream. The American Dreamers are excited to present their tour to the world and hope to incite the American Dream in the hearts of their fans.</h4>
