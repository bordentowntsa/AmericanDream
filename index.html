   <p style = "font-size: 35px;">
     Four young men from different corners of the world chose to come together to form the famous boyband, The American Dreamers. These four dreamers wished to leave the struggles of their past lives behind and achieve great heights in the American music industry. Fortunately, their American dream is being fulfilled for they have won two Grammy Awards in the past two years and are currently nominated for the next Grammy Awards.
